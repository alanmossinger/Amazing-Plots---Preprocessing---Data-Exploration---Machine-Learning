What is EDA with Python?
A. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python involves analyzing and summarizing data to gain insights and understand its underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions using Python programming language.

Q2. How to make EDA in Python?
A. To perform EDA in Python, you can use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These libraries provide functions and tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, which facilitate the process of exploring and understanding the data.

Q3. Which is the best EDA tool Python?
A. The choice of the best EDA tool in Python depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Some popular EDA tools include Jupyter Notebook (with the aforementioned libraries), Plotly, Tableau, and Power BI. Each tool offers unique features and capabilities, so it’s advisable to explore them and choose the one that suits your needs best.

Q4. How to perform EDA in machine learning?
A. Performing EDA in machine learning typically involves preprocessing the data by handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling. Then, various statistical and visual techniques can be employed to analyze the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and assess the relevance of features. This helps in gaining a better understanding of the data before building a machine learning model.
